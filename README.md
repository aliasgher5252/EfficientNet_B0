"Vegetable Detection using EfficientNet-B0 with PyTorch, TIMM, and Albumentations ü•¶ü•ï

Welcome to the Vegetable Detection project, where we explore the world of computer vision and deep learning to identify and classify various vegetables using state-of-the-art techniques. In this repository, we have employed the power of EfficientNet-B0, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture, in combination with PyTorch, TIMM (a versatile image model library), and Albumentations (for image augmentations) to create an accurate and efficient vegetable detection system.

üå± **Key Features:**

- **EfficientNet-B0 Model:** We have leveraged the architecture of EfficientNet-B0, known for its excellent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it ideal for real-world applications.
  
- **PyTorch:** The entire project is implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, allowing us to easily construct, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

- **TIMM Integration:** The Transfer Image Model Library (TIMM) has been utilized to seamlessly incorporate the EfficientNet-B0 architecture into our project. TIMM provides a collection of pre-trained models and efficient model implementation, streamlining our development process.
  
- **Albumentations for Data Augmentations:** To enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities, we have applied Albumentations, a powerful image augmentation library, ensuring better handling of various lighting conditions, rotations, and more.

- **Dataset:** Our model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising a diverse range of vegetable images, enabling it to recognize and classify different types of vegetables accurately.
  
- **Evaluation and Fine-tuning:** We provide scripts for evaluating the model's performance, and guidelines for fine-tuning the network on custom datasets for specific applications.
  
- **Usage Guide:** The repository includes a user-friendly guide to help you set up the environment, train the model, perform inference, and even contribute to the project.

ü•¨ **Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Prepare your dataset or use our sample dataset for training and validation.
